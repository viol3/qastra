# Icon Placeholder

The extension needs PNG icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

You can use the icon.svg as a template and convert it to PNG using:
- Online tools like https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Command line tools like ImageMagick: `convert icon.svg -resize 128x128 icon128.png`

For now, the extension will work without icons but they're recommended for a better user experience.
